##git branch

Branching is the safe and efficient way to test out new code (or ideas!) on top of existing, working code without breaking anything.  When combined with GitHub, it also offers a very robust, collaborative design and development framework.  

To get started, navigate to your local copy of `teaching-materials` and type

```Bash
git branch
```

Unless you've already created a branch, you should see something like this:

```Bash
git branch
* master
```
