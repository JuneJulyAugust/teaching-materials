For instance, matrix elements in one column are stored at a distance equal to the number of columns of that matrix. Cache associativity and cache line size get into conflict if one wants to hold, for instance, a small rectangular section of such a matrix in cache, leading to cache trashing. This means the elements accessed by the kernel are mapped to the same cache locations and hence are moved in and out during computation. One simple solution is to copy the desired block into a contiguous temporary buffer. That incurs a one-time cost but allievates cache trashing. Ths optimization os often called buffering."

      "\n",
